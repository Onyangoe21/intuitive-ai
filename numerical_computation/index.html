        <h2>Essence of Numerical Computation in Learning AI</h2>
        <p>You have seen that in understanding knowledge, we communicate in probabilities. After finding representation and knowing how to connect it to the outer world, as you can imagine, there is a lot to do processing the actual data and a lot of times, this data is in very large numbers and cannot simply be plugged into a formula for an answer. The process has to take a bit of time. </p>
        <p>Numerical computation in AI is like the backbone of the learning process. It involves processing data, training models, and making predictions. This includes normalizing data to make it consistent, performing complex mathematical operations to train the AI, and optimizing models to improve their accuracy. Numerical methods help in evaluating how well the models perform and making necessary adjustments.</p>

        <h2>What does Numerical Computation Entail?</h2>
        <p>
            Numerical computation mainly involves processes that can be handled iteratively like:
